        I'm a 23-year-old Uni student, about to enter Year 3 of my Computer Engineering course in NUS.<br><br>

          A short section here, but I like anime (and manga), since my Secondary School days.<br>
          It's probably the easiest (a.k.a cheapest) form of entertainment/hobby to get into, if you think about it ðŸ˜‚.<br>
          Here's my <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/brainaden" target="_blank" class="border-2 rounded-md">MAL account</a> if you're interested.
