            <b>Running</b><br />
            <p class="ml-6">
              Recently started running during the Winter'22 break, and it's
              been going great. I'm still pretty slow, but I just find
              myself yearning to go run every single day. Guess it's a good kind of addiction :))<br /><br />

              <i>If you've not started running/exercising often, I urge you to!</i><br />
              Over the first 1.5 months of running almost daily, I've come upon these benefits:
              <ol class="list-decimal list-inside marker:font-bold">
                <li>Runner's high - you feel great after each run (most of the time)</li>
                <li>During fun (more relaxed) runs, you feel great when you go into a state of flow and find your rhythm</li>
                <li>Clears your Mind (esp. after a long day at work/school)</li>
                <li>Burns calories! Sometimes you feel fat after a large meal, right? Run!</li>
                <li>Get fitter (invest in your body now!)</li>
              </ol>
              <br />

              Also, I think the perfect running form is so beautiful, and I'll continue trying to achieve it :)
