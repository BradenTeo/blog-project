        <h1 class="font-bold">Disclaimer</h1>
        <p>
          1 in 3 people in Singapore will be diagnosed with cancer some time in their lives. Odds are, 
          you know someone who has cancer, has had cancer, or will have cancer in the future. I didn't 
          realise it back then, but this is the reality we live in - one where our lives can change 
          <i>very</i> drastically whithin a <i>very</i> short time.<br><br>

          For me, even though I was diagnosed with cancer at a relatively young age (23yo), I'm thankful 
          that it is a cancer that is very treatable. Others are not as lucky...<br><br>

          I hope that when you read through my journey, you can understand that I'm only one person; 
          that cancer affects each person differently and that I only speak from the experience of a 
          particularly small group of cancer patients (Stage 2 Hodgkin's Lymphoma).

        What went down
      </h1>

      <p class="m-2 border-4 p-4 rounded-lg">
        Early this February, I noticed a few lumps forming on my left shoulder and neck. 
        To my alarm, in just a week's time, the growths had spread rapidly over a larger area, 
        and also felt hard to the touch. &#129300;
        <br><br>
        I went to a GP (after my last Midterm examination in school) and thankfully, 
        he immediately referred me to SGH's A&E. After some tests, I was told I had to be warded
        at the hospital to conduct further investigations. I still remember having to stay up 
        till <b>1am</b> before I was even given a bed &#128549;, probably due to the high number of 
        Covid patients requiring beds too.
        <br><br>
        Anywho, I was warded for a couple of days, during which 3 crucial things ocurred:
        <ol class="list-decimal ml-4">
          <li class="py-3">
            I had to go through a <u>biopsy</u> &#128549; (which is a surgical procedure to extract a 
            sample of the tissue from my shoulder, so that tests can be run to determine the nature
            of my illness)<br>
            <i>Spoiler: The procedure hurt like heck!! Even under local anaesthesia!</i>
          </li>
          <li class="py-3">
            I was given my fateful 
            <a href="https://www.singhealth.com.sg/patient-care/conditions-treatments/lymphoma" target="_blank" class="underline">
              diagnosis
            </a> &#129319;. It was a bit of a shock back then.
          </li>
          <li class="py-3">
            I had a <u>tube</u> stuck into my chest &#128576;. <br>
            This tube can deliver fluids into a larger vein compared to using a standard IV line.
            It can be used to administer chemotherapy drugs, and to easily get blood samples.
            <img src="~/assets/images/cancer/cvc_line.jpg" alt="cvc line"/>
            Thankfully, the procedure for this was painless &#128519;.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <span class="text-gray-600">
          Did you know? Medical procedures (e.g. surgery) can only be done on weekdays. 
          Who knew doctors have to rest too :P
        </span>
        <br><br>
        So as you can tell, hospital stay was a bit taxing and I was glad I was finally out after 
        <b>1 week</b>.<br><br>
        
        The next phase soon began a week later, and I started seeing this building really often -- 
        as I started going for chemotherapy, blood tests, scans, and doctor consultations.

        <b>4 months later~~</b><br>
        8 rounds of chemo DONE!<br>
        Now just left with 15 days of radiotherapy!

        Struggles
      </h1>
      <div class="m-2 border-4 p-4 rounded-lg">
        <h2 class="font-bold">Physical</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Hair loss - This kicked in only after ~2 months into chemo.</li>
          <li>Less appetite (lasts for 3-4 days after chemo)</li>
          <li>Insomnia (lasts for 1-2 days after chemo)</li>
          <li>Weight gain</li>
          <li>Fatigue</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This list could be longer but I'm glad it's as short as it is. Before I had started 
          my first chemo, my doctor had pre-empted me of all the possible side effects and 
          the list was looooong.
        </p><br><br>

        <h2 class="font-bold">Mental and Emotional</h2>
        <p>
          I have to admit that I felt really down at times.<br><br>
          
          I had to essentially quarantine myself at home for <b>5 months</b> -- not going out of the house
          except for my treatment to reduce interaction with others.
          My parents and I felt that this was a necessity, since chemotherapy weakens my immune system and 
          would make me more susceptibile to other illnesses. My doctor had also mentioned that my 
          treatment may have to be delayed if I got Covid (and I did NOT want that to happen, as
          I had to also worry about whether to return back to school later in August).<br><br>
          
          BUT even though I took precautions, I somehow still got Covid halfway through my journey. 
          I had to be hospitalised AGAIN. For 5 days. Yes, that sucked, but at that point in time, it was 
          all right as it was a change of pace (as weird as that sounds), because I was actually facing 
          interpersonal issues at home too &#128556;. Anyway, I eventually recovered, things calmed down, 
          and everything went back to "normal".<br><br>

          However, "normal" was me being alone in my room whilst the Summer holidays went on. Of course,
          I would love to be able go out and have fun, but I reminded myself that I was fighting a long, 
          drawn-out war and I have to pull through this unpleasant time.

        I'm not someone who expresses his gratitude nearly enough, but I'm really thankful for everyone

              I cannot understate how much a role the nurses played in my treatment, as they helped to 
              change the dressing of my CVC line every week and also helped administer chemotheraphy.
              They are MVPs.
              <br>              
              My doctor kept things real with me, gave me a clear picture of my situation at every step
              of the way, and also was really encouraging.
